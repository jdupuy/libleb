# Longest Edge Bisection Library

This library provides algorithms suitable for computing longest edge bisections on multicore processors, including GPUs using the [Concurrent Binary Tree library](https://github.com/jdupuy/libcbt). More details are available in my paper ["Concurrent Binary Trees (with application to Longest Edge Bisection)"](https://onrendering.com/).


**GPU implementation**
The GLSL folder provides a GLSL implementation of the library. An HLSL port of the library would also be welcome.
For a GPU implementation example, see [this repo](https://github.com/jdupuy/LongestEdgeBisection2D).
